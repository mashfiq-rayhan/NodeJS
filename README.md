# NodeJS : My Journey with Node.js

NodeJS Master is a comprehensive workspace of Node.js and JavaScript projects. The folder structure is organized by topic and complexity, starting from Node.js basics and JavaScript essentials to advanced backend features like authentication, REST APIs, real-time communication, file uploads, and integration with databases such as MongoDB and MySQL.

## ✨ Features

- 📚 Step-by-step projects for Node.js fundamentals, Express.js, and backend architecture
- 🛠️ Real-world mini-apps and full-stack examples with REST and real-time (Socket.io) clients
- 🔒 Authentication and authorization with sessions, cookies, CSRF protection, and JWT
- 🗄️ Database integration with MongoDB (Mongoose), MySQL (Sequelize), and native drivers
- 📁 File upload/download handling with Multer
- ✅ Robust input validation and error handling
- 🏗️ MVC architecture and modular code organization
- 📧 Email sending, payments, and pagination implementations
- ⚡ Asynchronous programming with callbacks, promises, and async/await
- 🛡️ Production-ready patterns: environment variables, security, and deployment
